# wkbparse

wkbparse is a Python module written in Rust for parsing EWKB and TWKB geometries into GeoJSON strings or GeoJSON-like Python dictionaries.


Original EWKB/TWKB encoding code forked from [https://github.com/Mortal/rust-ewkb](https://github.com/Mortal/rust-ewkb) which in turn originates from [https://github.com/andelf/rust-postgis](https://github.com/andelf/rust-postgis).
